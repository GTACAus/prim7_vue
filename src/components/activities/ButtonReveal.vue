  BUTTON REVEAL
  The simplest activity: press a button, something appears (an answer,
  another section, anything). Covers the "stop and check" pattern and
  similar "click to reveal" buttons.

    <ButtonReveal id="myCheck" v-slot="{ pressed, press }" @press="...">
      <p>Why does X happen?</p>

      <div v-if="pressed">Because of Y.</div>

      <button v-if="!pressed" type="button" @click="press">
        Check Your Answer
      </button>
    </ButtonReveal>

  The slot gets { pressed, press, reset }; the markup decides what to show
  before and after the press (leave the button out of the v-if for one that
  stays clickable). The activity is complete as soon as it has been pressed,
  so the section's Next button appears on its own.

  - reveals="#otherId, .some-class": elements anywhere on the page, for content
    that can't sit inside the slot, shown on press and hidden again on reset.
  - @press fires on every press, to do anything else the page needs.
  - reset (a [data-reset-trigger] inside it, a section-wide reset button, its
    depends-on activity being reset, or reset() through a template ref) un-presses it.
  - id, class and data-* attributes fall through to the root element
    (tag="section" etc. changes the element; default is div). With an id, plain
    page scripts reach it as getActivity(id).
