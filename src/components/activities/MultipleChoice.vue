  MULTIPLE CHOICE
  One or more questions, each with its own choice buttons. Lay them out however
  the page likes - only the three components matter:

    <MultipleChoice completion-mode="live" v-slot="{ reset }">
      <McQuestion answer="basketballs" class="ball-pair-grid">
        <McChoice value="basketballs" v-slot="{ selected, correct }">
          <img ... />
          <span v-if="selected">{{ correct ? "Yes!" : "Try again" }}</span>
        </McChoice>
        <McChoice value="tennis">...</McChoice>
      </McQuestion>

      <Button @click="reset">Reset</Button>
    </MultipleChoice>

  A choice is right when its value matches its question's answer.

  Props
  - completionMode: "sticky" (default) - a question stays done once it has been
    answered right; "live" - only the latest pick counts, so a wrong pick
    after a right one un-completes it.
  - sequence: show one question at a time; a right answer moves to the next.
  - classes: rename the classes put on a picked choice - defaults
    { selected: "selected-answer", correct: "correct-answer",
      incorrect: "incorrect-answer" }.

  Slot props: MultipleChoice { reset, complete }, McQuestion { picked,
  answered, correct }, McChoice { selected, correct }.
  @answer gets { question, value, correct } on every pick.

  Complete once every question satisfies completionMode. The picks are saved
  through <Activity :state>. Give each McQuestion a `name` if questions can be
  added or removed; otherwise their order is used.
